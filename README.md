Overview
This project provides a backend API for recommending books based on user preferences, powered by a machine learning model developed in Python. The model is trained and evaluated in ml.ipynb, and the API is served using main.py.

Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommendation.git
cd book-recommendation
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Backend API
To start the backend server (from main.py):

bash
python main.py
By default, the API will be available at http://localhost:5000/ (or the port specified in your code).

Running the Machine Learning Notebook
Open ml.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

bash
jupyter notebook ml.ipynb
Follow the notebook steps to train, evaluate, or improve the recommendation model.

API Endpoints
Note: Update this section based on your actual API endpoints.

GET /recommend?user_id=<id>: Get book recommendations for a user.

POST /feedback: Submit user feedback for recommendations.

Machine Learning Notebook
The ml.ipynb notebook contains all the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can modify and rerun cells to experiment with different algorithms or parameters.

Dependencies
All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. Install them with:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
